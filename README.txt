# Affex
Developed by Affex

Build 001 of the Affex Library tool. 
This is a script that is designed to run within Houdini.
When initiated from Houdini you are able to export and import files to a local library. (Online library is in the works)

To use this script, add the code that is inside the "initiate.py" file to a new shelf tool.
